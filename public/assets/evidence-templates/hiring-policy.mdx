This Hiring policy is to provide guidelines and standard procedures for the onboarding process of new employees at companyName.

The following are the main process steps we follow as part of recruitment:

1. Identify the hiring need

   The process begins by identifying the need within the organization. The positions are either newly formed or recently vacated. The vacancies can be filled by recruitment or by, reassigning the resources from other projects with less work, or assigning resources who have not been assigned to any specific project but match the required role. If the decision is to hire a new resource, we will proceed in that direction.

2. Advertise the Position

   This includes utilizing a combination of the company's website and social media platforms, job posting sites like LinkedIn, job fairs, and word-of-mouth recruitment.

   We compare the candidate’s resume and other materials to the job requirements we have. The education qualification conforms what we have in the requirements. For all the technical and technology manger roles we hire only Computer Science/IT/Electronics Engineering graduates or postgraduates in computer science/Applications/IT. We check if this person’s prior job experience and skills line up with the essential requirements. We also look at the time spent in previous roles. We check if the candidate’s history of jobs demonstrates progression and drive or a tendency to bounce from job to job. Phone screenings are conducted from the HR side. Phone screening will determine the candidate’s availability and other essential requirements we have also in addition to validating what has been mentioned in the resume.

5. Technical Assessment/Interviews

   Interviews are typically conducted by a panel of 1 or multiple persons.
