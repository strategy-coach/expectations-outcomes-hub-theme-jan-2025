#### Architecture

##### 1. **Core Framework and Language**
- **NodeJS with TypeScript-First Deployment**:
  - Use NodeJS for server-side scripting and deployment infrastructure.
  - Adopt a TypeScript-first approach to enforce type-safety and reduce runtime errors.

##### 2. **Frontend Framework**
- **Astro 5 Framework**:
  - Use Astro 5 for building the microsites, taking advantage of its performance benefits for static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR).
  - Favor SSG for most pages to ensure high performance, scalability, and lower hosting costs.
  - Allow SSR for pages or components requiring dynamic code execution, such as user-specific dashboards or real-time content updates.

##### 3. **Dynamic Functionality**
- **HTMx for Dynamic Interactivity**:
  - Leverage HTMx as a lightweight solution for sprinkling dynamic functionality where needed, without requiring a full SPA approach.
  - Use HTMx to enhance user experience by enabling dynamic interactions, such as inline updates or partial page refreshes, with minimal overhead.

##### 4. **GitHub Repository Strategy**
- Use this `github.com/strategy-coach/expectations-outcomes-hub-theme-jan-2025` private repo to house the reusable **Expectations and Outcomes Hub Theme (EOHT)**:
  - This theme will act as a base for all microsites and follow best practices established by Astro themes.
  - Centralize shared styles, components, and configurations.

##### 5. **Reusable Components**
- **Astro Integrations**:
  - Develop one or more Astro Integrations to encapsulate reusable functionality, such as authentication workflows, analytics integration, or customer-specific widgets.
  - Favor Web Components for maximum reusability across frameworks.
  - Where Web Components are not feasible, fallback to Astro components or React components, ensuring they remain decoupled and composable.

##### 6. **Subdomain Management**
- Host each Customer Hub instance in its own private repository and deploy it as a subdomain on the master domain (e.g., `customer1.example.com`, `customer2.example.com`).
- Automate domain configuration and SSL certificate provisioning using tools like Let's Encrypt and DNS management APIs.

#### Technology Strategy

##### 1. **Code Reuse and Modularity**
- Emphasize the **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principle:
  - Centralize common logic, styles, and assets in the `github.com/strategy-coach/expectations-outcomes-hub-theme-*` EOHT repository.
  - Use Astro Integrations to package reusable modules.
- Structure the `github.com/strategy-coach/expectations-outcomes-hub-theme-*` EOHT repository for extensibility:
  - Separate shared components into distinct directories or packages.
  - Use TypeScript types/interfaces to enforce consistent API contracts between components.

##### 2. **Astro’s Content Layer**
- Use the Astro Content Layer for managing customer-specific content, such as:
  - Blog posts, documentation, and knowledge bases.
  - Configuration files for custom layouts or branding.
