## Security Report

Here is a detailed Markdown template for a **Lightweight Penetration Testing Report**, including **Nmap** and other commonly used penetration testing tools. It follows best practices for penetration testing documentation, with full English narratives and placeholders for inserting results.

### **Lightweight Penetration Testing Report**
**Confidential Document**  
_(Authorized personnel only)_  

---

## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Purpose of this Report**
This document provides a high-level summary of the penetration test performed against the target environment. The goal of this engagement was to assess the security posture of the identified assets by identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential attack vectors.

### **1.2 Scope of Assessment**
- **Target IP(s)/Host(s):** `[Insert target information]`
- **Date of Assessment:** 26/02/2025
- **Testing Methodology:**  
  - Passive reconnaissance
  - Active scanning
  - Exploitation testing _(if authorized)_
  - Post-exploitation _(if applicable)_
  - Reporting and remediation recommendations

### **1.3 Tools Used**
- **Nmap** (Network discovery & service enumeration) ingested via `surveilr`


---

## **2. Executive Summary**
This section provides a high-level overview of the findings, focusing on critical vulnerabilities and security risks.

- **Overall Security Posture:** `[Insert summary]`
- **Critical Vulnerabilities Identified:** `[List major issues]`
- **Key Remediation Recommendations:** `[Provide actionable security improvements]`
- **Impact Assessment:** `[Describe how vulnerabilities could be exploited]`

---

## **3. Methodology**
The penetration test was conducted using the following phased approach:

### **3.1 Reconnaissance & Information Gathering**
- **Passive reconnaissance:** OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and WHOIS lookups.
- **Active scanning:** Identified live hosts and open ports using Nmap.
- **Subdomain enumeration:** `[Tool used, e.g., Subfinder, Amass]`
- **Technologies fingerprinted:** `[Insert results]`

### **3.2 Scanning & Enumeration**
The following scans were conducted to gather information about the target:

#### **3.2.1 Nmap Scan Results**
**Key open ports and services detected:**

<SecurityReport />

### **3.3 Web Application Scanning**

#### **3.3.1 Directory Enumeration**
| Path | Status Code | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| /admin | 200 | Admin panel exposed |
| /backup | 403 | Forbidden but exists |
| /uploads | 200 | File uploads accessible |

### **3.4 Exploitation & Vulnerability Assessment**
#### **3.4.1 SQL Injection Testing**
Vulnerable Parameter: `user`
Database Name(s): `[List of exposed databases]`

#### **3.4.2 Brute-Force Testing**
```
[If credentials were discovered, document them]
```

### **3.5 Post-Exploitation (If Applicable)**
- Privilege escalation findings.
- Pivoting techniques used.
- Access to sensitive files.

## **4. Findings & Recommendations**
### **4.1 High-Risk Vulnerabilities**
| ID | Vulnerability | Risk Level | Affected Component | Recommendation |
|----|--------------|------------|--------------------|---------------|
| V-001 | Open SSH port | High | SSH (Port 22) | Restrict access with firewall rules |
| V-002 | SQL Injection | Critical | Login page | Implement prepared statements |
| V-003 | Outdated Apache version | Medium | Web server | Upgrade to latest version |

### **4.2 Medium & Low-Risk Vulnerabilities**
| ID | Vulnerability | Risk Level | Affected Component | Recommendation |
|----|--------------|------------|--------------------|---------------|
| V-004 | Missing security headers | Medium | Web application | Implement X-Frame-Options & CSP |
| V-005 | Exposed directories | Low | Web server | Restrict access to sensitive directories |

---

## **5. Conclusion**
This penetration test identified `[X]` critical, `[Y]` medium, and `[Z]` low-severity vulnerabilities. The most concerning issue was `[Highlight major vulnerability]`, which could lead to `[Impact description]`. Immediate remediation is advised.
