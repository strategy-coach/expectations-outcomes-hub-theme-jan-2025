This Termination policy is to set forth guidelines and standard procedures for the process of off-boarding and terminating employees at companyName. 

## Off-boarding and Termination

- The hiring manager informs HR whenever they terminate or an employee leaves the companyName.

- Upon receiving the notification, IT promptly terminates the access.
- Request a letter of resignation
- Inform HR department and negotiate the exit dates based on project needs
- Permission/Access termination - HR to immediately request IT to revoke the access rights (email, database, network, Git, physical locations)
- Return of assets allotted and acceptance by IT
- IT and the project managers to decide on the data that is created on the assets by exiting employees and initiate back up of that data
- Anything that is very critical information like encryption keys details, passwords, user administration should be revoked by IT
- Project hand over to others and acceptance by the project manager
- Exit interview
- Financial settlements

## When an employee changes roles within the companyName

- The hiring manager will inform HR about the change in role.
- HR and IT will follow the same steps as outlined in the on-boarding process to modify access according to the new role and in the off-boarding process to remove access that is no longer necessary.

## Review of accounts and permissions:

- IT and HR will review accounts and permission levels for accuracy each quarter.
