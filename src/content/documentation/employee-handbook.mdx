## Performance Evaluation

Performance Evaluation (PE) has been designed to help develop a plan for the employee’s growth and success. It is an on-going process involving the employee and his/her supervisor(s) who discuss job performance and goals, identify and correct weaknesses, recognize and foster strengths and decide on approaches to meeting goals.

PE helps review salaries, determine training needs and explore the ways and means of achieving the goals.

Generally, each employee undergoes PE at the end of probation, upon completing a project and at the end of every 6 months.

**4.1 Guidelines for Evaluation**

A companyName which manages its human resources well will ensure that the goals of the individuals are aligned to that of the company. Whether or not this is happening can only be determined within a framework of an objective assessment of the performance of the employees. Moreover, systematic planning of performance objectives and assessment of the level of achievement of the objectives are essential for identifying gaps, suggesting corrective measures, planning the career, determining the rewards and most importantly ensuring a continual improvement in employee performance.

The success of an effective performance management system is predicated on the following:

   - **Objective Setting:** Understanding and agreeing of roles by the Appraiser and the Appraisee; defining performance goals; and linking to company goals.
   - **Performance Evaluation:** Self appraisal; assessment of the appraisal by the Appraiser and review of the appraisal.
   - **Performance Development:** Competency development, counselling and feedback, mentoring and coaching for the development of individuals
   - **Recognition and Reward:** Performance based Salary revision and rewards

**4.2 The Process of Appraisal: Points to Keep in Mind**

**Points for the Appraiser**

The fundamental basis of appraisal is open, frank and constructive discussion between the Appraiser and the Appraisee.

Every employee needs to know how he/she is doing, what he/she can do better and how he/she can develop.

Although appraisals are undertaken every six months or at the end of projects, it is advisable to have informal discussions and feedback as an ongoing exercise. The written appraisals shall reflect these feedbacks. Let there be no surprises.

Performance appraisal discussion should cover both performance review and career growth.

During the appraisal discussion, the Appraiser should acknowledge and congratulate the employee for his/her efforts and mention accomplishments.

During the discussions, the Appraiser shall avoid rushing through sensitive areas, becoming defensive, letting one item hog the discussion, making unsustainable commitments and comparing between individuals.

If there is a serious disagreement between the Appraiser and the Appraisee on a performance issue: be specific about the performance shortcoming, get the employee to agree that there is a problem and that it is his/her responsibility to correct the performance and hold the employee accountable for implementing the corrective plan within the agreed time frame.

**Points for the Appraisee**

In the final reckoning, the impact of the process of appraisal is most on the Appraisee.
Hence the Appraisee should: - Ensure that the appraisal process proceeds on schedule - Seek clarifications required from the Appraiser or HR - Be open and frank in stating his/her views before the Appraiser - Ask for data in support of feedback - Identify areas of development with the Appraiser - Seek guidance and feedback from the Appraiser (Structured formats employed for PE are available with HR)

## Training and Development

Need-based training and development programmes may be provided to employees to impart and/or upgrade the required technical and other skills relevant to their jobs and functions.

## Compensation and Benefits

The Company’s compensation policy is designed to value and reward an employee’s performance and his / her acquiring skills, competencies and business knowledge. The compensation policy attempts to:

   - Attract motivate and retain high performing professionals who contribute to the achievement of the company’s business objectives.
   - Maintain pay competitiveness in relation to the external labour market
   - Maintain, within the organization, equity and fairness based on the performance of and the responsibility assumed by the employee
   - Provide a system that communicates and reinforces the linkage between the employee’s and company’s performance

The compensation package will include gross salary, performance related rewards, and other benefits introduced from time to time.

Mode of payment: Salary will be credited to the employee’s account, opened with the bank of the company.

## Providing a Healthy Working Environment

companyName is committed to provide an open and frank working environment where any problem, complaint, suggestion, or question can be aired at an appropriate forum, and will be responded to by the management promptly and sympathetically.

**Problem Resolution**

The Company will strive to ensure fair and honest treatment of all employees who, in turn, are expected to treat each other with mutual respect. Employees will have the freedom to offer positive and constructive criticism. If employees disagree with established rules of conduct, policies, or practices, they can express their concern through the problem resolution procedure. No employee will be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a complaint with the Company in a reasonable, business-like manner, or for using the problem resolution procedure.

If a situation occurs when an employee believes that a condition of employment or a decision affecting him/her is unjust or inequitable, he/she is encouraged to make use of the following steps. The employee may discontinue the procedure at any step. - Employee presents a given problem to the immediate superior. If the employee believes the immediate superior is not the appropriate person to resolve his/her problem, he / she are at liberty to present the problem to the head of the Group. - It is the responsibility of the superior / head of the group to discuss the problem with appropriate level of management and find a solution or initiate the necessary steps to a solution. - If the problem is unresolved, the employee can present the problem directly to the HR Group which will resolve the problem in consultation with the CEO or other designated authority, within the shortest possible time. The decision of the review panel will be communicated to the employee. - An employee has the freedom to approach CEO at any time to report their concerns.

Not every problem can be resolved to everyone’s complete satisfaction, but only through understanding and discussion of mutual problems can employees and the management develop confidence and trust in each other. This confidence and trust are the most contributing factors in creating a healthy environment.

**Corrective Disciplinary Action**

The purpose of corrective disciplinary action, short of termination, is to encourage employees to improve their performance or conduct so that they may continue their employment with the company.

The process will involve:

   - Notice describing the nature of the employee’s action/shortcoming/poor performance and seeking explanation of the employee within a prescribed time
