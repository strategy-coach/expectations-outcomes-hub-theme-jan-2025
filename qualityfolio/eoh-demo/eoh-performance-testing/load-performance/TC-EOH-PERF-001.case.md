### Description

To verify that the EOH theme dashboard maintains acceptable performance levels when accessed by multiple concurrent users, ensuring scalability and user experience under realistic load conditions.

### Pre-Conditions:

- The EOH theme application is deployed in a production-like environment
- Performance testing tools (JMeter/Artillery) are configured
- Baseline performance metrics have been established
- Monitoring and logging systems are active
- Test user accounts are prepared for load testing

### Test Steps:

1. **Step 1**: Establish baseline performance with single user
   - **Action**: Single user accesses dashboard and performs typical operations
   - **Metrics**: Record response times, resource usage, and page load times
   - **Expected**: Baseline metrics within acceptable thresholds

2. **Step 2**: Test with 10 concurrent users
   - **Load Pattern**: 10 users simultaneously accessing dashboard
   - **Duration**: 5 minutes sustained load
   - **Operations**: Login, dashboard navigation, project viewing, content access
   - **Expected**: Response times remain within 2x baseline

3. **Step 3**: Test with 25 concurrent users
   - **Load Pattern**: 25 users with realistic usage patterns
   - **Duration**: 10 minutes sustained load
   - **Operations**: Mixed operations including content creation and collaboration
   - **Expected**: Response times remain within 3x baseline

4. **Step 4**: Test with 50 concurrent users
   - **Load Pattern**: 50 users simulating peak usage scenario
   - **Duration**: 15 minutes sustained load
   - **Operations**: Full range of EOH theme functionality
   - **Expected**: System remains stable, response times acceptable

5. **Step 5**: Stress test with 100 concurrent users
   - **Load Pattern**: 100 users pushing system limits
   - **Duration**: 10 minutes stress test
   - **Operations**: Heavy dashboard usage, content operations, API calls
   - **Expected**: System degrades gracefully, no failures

6. **Step 6**: Recovery and stability validation
   - **Action**: Reduce load back to normal levels
   - **Expected**: System recovers to baseline performance
   - **Expected**: No memory leaks or resource exhaustion

### Expected Result:

- **Performance Thresholds**:
  - Dashboard load time: < 3 seconds under normal load
  - API response time: < 1 second for standard operations
  - Page transitions: < 2 seconds between dashboard sections
- **Scalability Metrics**:
  - 50 concurrent users: Acceptable performance maintained
  - 100 concurrent users: Graceful degradation, no system failures
  - Resource utilization: CPU < 80%, Memory < 85%
- **User Experience**:
  - No timeouts or connection errors
  - Consistent functionality across all load levels
  - Responsive design maintains usability

### Post-Conditions:

- System returns to baseline performance after load reduction
- No data corruption or loss during high load periods
- All monitoring systems show healthy metrics
- Performance logs are available for analysis

### Load Test Configuration:

```yaml
load_test_config:
  scenarios:
    - name: "Dashboard Access"
      users: [1, 10, 25, 50, 100]
      duration: ["1m", "5m", "10m", "15m", "10m"]
      operations:
        - login: 100%
        - dashboard_view: 90%
        - project_navigation: 70%
        - content_access: 50%
        - collaboration: 30%
  
  performance_thresholds:
    response_time_p95: 3000ms
    error_rate: < 1%
    throughput: > 100 req/sec
```
