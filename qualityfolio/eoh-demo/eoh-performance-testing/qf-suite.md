## Scope of Work

The performance testing will cover the following critical areas across the EOH Theme ecosystem:

### Page Load Performance

- **Initial Page Load**: Measure time to first contentful paint and largest contentful paint
- **Static Site Generation**: Validate build times and generated asset optimization
- **Image Loading**: Test image optimization, lazy loading, and progressive enhancement
- **JavaScript Bundle Performance**: Measure bundle sizes and execution times

### API Performance

- **Response Times**: Test API endpoint response times under normal and peak loads
- **Database Query Performance**: Validate database query optimization and indexing
- **Caching Effectiveness**: Test cache hit rates and cache invalidation strategies
- **Rate Limiting**: Verify proper rate limiting implementation and performance impact

### Scalability Testing

- **Concurrent User Load**: Test system behavior with multiple simultaneous users
- **Content Volume Scaling**: Validate performance with large amounts of content
- **Database Scaling**: Test database performance under increased data loads
- **CDN Performance**: Validate content delivery network effectiveness

### Resource Utilization

- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during various operations
- **CPU Utilization**: Test CPU usage under different load conditions
- **Network Bandwidth**: Measure bandwidth usage and optimization
- **Storage Performance**: Test file system and database storage performance

### User Experience Metrics

- **Core Web Vitals**: Measure LCP, FID, and CLS for optimal user experience
- **Time to Interactive**: Test when pages become fully interactive
- **Progressive Loading**: Validate progressive enhancement and graceful degradation
- **Mobile Performance**: Test performance on mobile devices and slower networks

### Build & Deployment Performance

- **Build Time Optimization**: Measure and optimize Astro build times
