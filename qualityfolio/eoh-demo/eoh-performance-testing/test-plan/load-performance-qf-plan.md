## Test Plan Overview

This performance test plan validates the EOH theme's ability to handle various load conditions while maintaining acceptable performance levels for all user types and scenarios.

## Scope of Work

The load performance testing will cover the following critical areas:

### Baseline Performance Testing

- **Single User Performance**: Establish baseline performance metrics for individual users
- **Page Load Time Measurement**: Test initial page load times across all major pages
- **API Response Time Testing**: Measure baseline API endpoint response times
- **Resource Utilization Baseline**: Establish baseline CPU, memory, and network usage

### Concurrent User Load Testing

- **10 Concurrent Users**: Test system behavior with 10 simultaneous users
- **50 Concurrent Users**: Validate performance with moderate user load
- **100 Concurrent Users**: Test system scalability with high user load
- **Peak Load Testing**: Determine maximum sustainable concurrent user capacity

### Stress Testing Scenarios

- **CPU Stress Testing**: Test system behavior under high CPU utilization
- **Memory Stress Testing**: Validate performance under memory pressure
- **Database Stress Testing**: Test database performance under heavy query loads
- **Network Stress Testing**: Validate performance under network bandwidth constraints

### Scalability Assessment

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Test performance with multiple server instances
- **Vertical Scaling**: Validate performance improvements with increased resources
- **Database Scaling**: Test database performance scaling strategies
- **CDN Scaling**: Validate content delivery network scaling effectiveness

### Real-World Load Simulation

- **Daily Usage Patterns**: Simulate typical daily user activity patterns
- **Peak Hour Simulation**: Test performance during expected peak usage times
- **Content Publishing Load**: Simulate high content creation and publishing activity
- **Search and Discovery Load**: Test search functionality under heavy usage

### Performance Degradation Testing

- **Gradual Load Increase**: Test performance degradation patterns under increasing load
- **Breaking Point Identification**: Determine system failure points and recovery
- **Resource Exhaustion Testing**: Test behavior when system resources are exhausted
- **Recovery Time Testing**: Measure system recovery time after load reduction

### Mobile Performance Testing

- **Mobile Device Load Testing**: Test performance on various mobile devices
- **Network Condition Simulation**: Test performance under different network conditions
- **Battery Impact Assessment**: Measure battery usage impact on mobile devices
- **Touch Interaction Performance**: Test touch interface responsiveness under load

### Caching Performance Testing

- **Cache Hit Rate Testing**: Measure cache effectiveness under various load conditions
- **Cache Invalidation Testing**: Test cache invalidation performance and impact
- **CDN Performance Testing**: Validate CDN performance under geographic load distribution
- **Browser Cache Testing**: Test browser caching effectiveness and performance
