## Scope of Work

The security testing will cover the following critical areas across the EOH Theme ecosystem:

### Authentication & Authorization

- **User Authentication**: Verify secure login mechanisms, password policies, and session management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Test proper enforcement of user roles and permissions
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Validate MFA implementation where applicable
- **Session Security**: Test session timeout, secure cookies, and session hijacking prevention

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Test all database interactions for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Validate proper input sanitization and output encoding
- **Command Injection**: Test for command injection vulnerabilities in system interactions
- **File Upload Security**: Verify secure handling of file uploads and content validation

### Data Protection

- **Data Encryption**: Verify encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Personal Data Handling**: Test compliance with data privacy regulations
- **Secure Configuration**: Validate secure default configurations and settings
- **API Security**: Test API endpoints for proper authentication and rate limiting

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Implementation**: Verify proper SSL/TLS configuration and certificate management
- **Security Headers**: Test implementation of security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- **CORS Configuration**: Validate Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
- **Environment Security**: Test separation of development, staging, and production environments

### Third-Party Integration Security

- **GitHub Integration**: Verify secure handling of GitHub API tokens and webhooks
- **External Service APIs**: Test secure communication with external services
- **Dependency Security**: Validate security of third-party packages and dependencies
- **CDN Security**: Test secure content delivery and asset protection

### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Known Vulnerability Scanning**: Test for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Identify potential security misconfigurations
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Test for unintended exposure of sensitive information
- **Broken Access Control**: Verify proper access control implementation

### Compliance & Standards

- **OWASP Top 10**: Test against OWASP Top 10 security risks
