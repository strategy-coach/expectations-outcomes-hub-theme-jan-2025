### Description

To verify that the EOH theme authentication system is properly protected against SQL injection attacks through comprehensive input validation and parameterized queries.

### Pre-Conditions:

- The EOH theme application is deployed and accessible
- Authentication endpoints are functional
- Database logging is enabled for security monitoring
- Security testing tools are configured and ready

### Test Steps:

1. **Step 1**: Test basic SQL injection in email field
   - **Email**: `admin@example.com' OR '1'='1' --`
   - **Password**: `anypassword`
   - **Expected**: Authentication fails, no SQL injection occurs

2. **Step 2**: Test union-based SQL injection
   - **Email**: `test@example.com' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`
   - **Password**: `password123`
   - **Expected**: Input is sanitized, no data exposure

3. **Step 3**: Test time-based blind SQL injection
   - **Email**: `admin@example.com'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05' --`
   - **Password**: `password`
   - **Expected**: No delay in response, injection prevented

4. **Step 4**: Test boolean-based blind SQL injection
   - **Email**: `admin@example.com' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) > 0 --`
   - **Password**: `password`
   - **Expected**: Standard error response, no information disclosure

5. **Step 5**: Test error-based SQL injection
   - **Email**: `admin@example.com' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(version(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY x)a) --`
   - **Password**: `password`
   - **Expected**: Generic error message, no database information exposed

6. **Step 6**: Verify logging and monitoring
   - **Action**: Check security logs for injection attempts
   - **Expected**: All attempts are logged with appropriate severity
   - **Expected**: Security alerts are triggered for suspicious activity

### Expected Result:

- **Security Protection**: 
  - All SQL injection attempts are blocked
  - Input validation prevents malicious queries
  - Parameterized queries are used throughout
- **Error Handling**:
  - Generic error messages only
  - No database structure information exposed
  - No sensitive data in error responses
- **Monitoring & Logging**:
  - All injection attempts are logged
  - Security alerts are triggered appropriately
  - Incident response procedures are activated

### Post-Conditions:

- Authentication system remains secure and functional
- No unauthorized access is granted
- Security logs contain detailed records of all attempts
- System performance is not impacted by injection attempts

### Security Test Vectors:

```sql
-- Basic OR injection
admin@example.com' OR '1'='1' --

-- Union-based injection
test@example.com' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --

-- Time-based blind injection
admin@example.com'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05' --

-- Boolean-based blind injection
admin@example.com' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) > 0 --

-- Error-based injection
admin@example.com' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(version(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY x)a) --
```

**Demo Context**: This security test case demonstrates comprehensive SQL injection testing. All attack vectors are synthetic and designed to validate security controls without causing actual harm to the demonstration system.
