### Overview

This test case group validates the complete user authentication system within the EOH theme, ensuring secure and reliable access management for all stakeholder types including project managers, team members, and administrators.

The authentication system is critical for:

- **Stakeholder Access Control**: Ensuring appropriate access levels for different user roles
- **Project Security**: Protecting sensitive project information and deliverables
- **Collaboration Management**: Enabling secure team collaboration and communication
- **Audit Compliance**: Maintaining proper access logs and security compliance
- **User Experience**: Providing seamless and intuitive authentication workflows

### Test Coverage Areas

- **User Registration & Onboarding**: Complete new user registration and account setup process
- **Login & Authentication**: Standard and social login mechanisms with security validations
- **Session Management**: Session creation, persistence, timeout, and security handling
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Verification of appropriate permissions for different user roles
- **Security Validations**: Protection against common authentication vulnerabilities
- **Profile Management**: User profile updates, password changes, and account management
- **Integration Testing**: Authentication integration with external services and databases
- **Mobile Authentication**: Authentication functionality on mobile devices and responsive design

### Key Scenarios Tested

1. **Stakeholder Onboarding Flow**: New project stakeholder registration and initial setup
2. **Project Manager Authentication**: Enhanced authentication for project management roles
3. **Team Member Access**: Standard team member login and collaboration access
4. **Administrator Access**: Full system access validation for administrative users
5. **Guest User Experience**: Limited access functionality for non-authenticated users
6. **Multi-Device Authentication**: Cross-device session management and synchronization
7. **Security Incident Response**: Authentication system behavior during security events
8. **Integration Workflows**: Authentication with GitHub, email services, and external APIs

### Success Criteria

- All authentication workflows complete successfully without errors
- Appropriate access levels are enforced for each user role
- Security measures prevent unauthorized access attempts
- User experience remains intuitive and efficient across all devices
- Integration with external services functions reliably
- Performance remains acceptable under normal and peak load conditions
